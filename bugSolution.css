One way to solve this issue is to avoid using `min-content` directly within the `calc()` function. Instead, you might use a different layout approach that better controls the element's width. For example, with flexbox you can leverage `flex-shrink` and `flex-grow`:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  width: 50%; /* Takes up 50% of available space */
  flex-shrink: 1; /* Allows shrinking if necessary */
  flex-grow: 1; /* Allows growing if there's extra space */
}
```

This approach allows the container to adapt its width more predictably, accommodating its content within the 50% width constraint.  The `flex-shrink` and `flex-grow` properties provide more control than directly using `min-content` in a `calc()` function with a percentage.
